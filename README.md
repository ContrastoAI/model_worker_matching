# 🧠 Worker Matching Model
This project develops a machine learning system to intelligently match workers with job opportunities based on historical activity, behavioral signals, and job characteristics. Designed to improve employment outcomes and operational efficiency, the model balances automation with human oversight, enabling teams to scale matching decisions while maintaining control and explainability.

## 🚀 Overview
The Worker Matching Model is a decision-support tool tailored for workforce platforms and HR systems. It leverages historical job data, behavioral patterns (e.g., churn, engagement, reliability), and job metadata to:

Recommend top candidates for a given job posting

Score the compatibility of job-worker pairs

Surface reasons for match strength to support recruiter decisions

The system is designed for B2B use, particularly for internal HR departments, staffing platforms, or employment marketplaces.

## 🔍 Functionality
Semi-autonomous decision support: Suggests candidates but keeps recruiters in the loop.

Behavioral and demographic inputs: Uses job history, attendance, and engagement data; may include basic demographic data for fairness checks.

Flexible retrieval architecture: Embedding-based similarity search using FAISS or similar.

## 🧱 Architecture
Embedding training via contrastive learning over worker-job interactions

Retrieval and scoring with vector databases (e.g. FAISS)

Explainability through SHAP-based attribution and metadata surface

Human-in-the-loop interface via internal APIs or platform dashboards

## 🔐 Data Characteristics
This system is trained using:

First-party behavioral and performance data

Public job descriptions and taxonomies

Optional demographic or sensitive fields for bias auditing (never used for decisions directly)

No personal data from minors or high-risk categories is used in production environments without additional safeguards.

## 📦 Setup
```
git clone https://github.com/your-org/worker-matching-model.git
cd worker-matching-model
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
🧪 Usage
python
Copy
Edit
from model import WorkerMatcher
matcher = WorkerMatcher()
scores = matcher.score(worker_profile, job_posting)

## ✅ Status
 Core model training

 Embedding export

 Explainability support

 Real-time API (WIP)

 Fairness dashboard (in progress)

## ⚖️ Impact & Context
The model is part of workforce management tools and may influence economic opportunities by helping workers connect with better-fitting jobs. Its deployment is intended to support and not replace human recruiters.

Key considerations:
Domain: Employment / HR

Impact scale: Moderate – affects platform users and HR teams

Potential impacts: Fairness in job access, economic inclusion

Transparency: Designed to provide recruiter-facing rationales

Robustness: Stress-tested across edge cases; security measures in place for inference APIs

Vulnerable groups: Attention to potential disparate impact across protected groups
